                        <p class="about_intropara">In 2015, to enhance PONT Airlines' competitive position in the highly-dynamic market, PONT Airlines updated and relaunched the Earth and Bamboo brand with significant improvements to its infrastructure, operations and fleet. Vietnamese cultural heritage continues to be an important theme for defining, differentiating and enriching the new PONT Airlines’s brand identity and image, and the Earth and Bamboo logo serves as a symbol of this commitment to heritage.</p>
